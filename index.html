      What is this website?
    </h3>
    <p class="text">
      Since Diego Aspinwall was a wee little child, he enjoyed speaking languages. Learning grammar, reading novels and writing his own ideas have always excited
      him. Because of this, Mr. Aspinwall decided to found his first website to entertain the public and raise awareness for the possibilities that languages bring
      to light. This website contains some of Diego's favorite languages with interactive tools to inspire creativity and insight.

      Who is Diego?
    </h3>
    <p class="text">
      Diego Aspinwall is a philanthropist, scholar and passionate bird watcher. Aspinwall's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Rivera">wikipedia page</a>
      details his artistic and philosophical ventures, but Aspinwall also enjoys less refined activities, such as
      <a href="https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/Athlete.aspx?AID=10609024">running</a>
       and
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_H%C3%B8sflot_Kl%C3%A6bo">nordic skiing</a>. He plays the violin,
      and enjoys all music classical (classical music, classic rock, classic punk...). After spending three years in Spain with his family and one year in Germany
       with a host family, Aspinwall claims partial fluency in Castilian (Iberian) Spanish and Swabian German. Diego is always inspired to learn, so he has begun
      working on
      <i>Igpay Atinlay</i>
       (Pig Latin) and Code (variations include Python, C, Javascript, SQL, HTML and CSS). Lorem Ipsum is still beyond his skill level.

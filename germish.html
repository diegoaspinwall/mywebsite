      Diego lived in Germany with a host family from August 2018 to July 2019. He was located in Baden-Württemberg, just outside of Stuttgart.
      During this time he learned "high" German in school, but also got
      to experience the local dialect, <i>Schwäbisch</i> (Swabian). This dialect is imfamous throughout Germany for funny and weird pronounciation.

      Diego lived in Santander, Spain with his family from September 2011 to July 2014. He went to a public catholic school with nuns and played
      baseball with the city's only team. Unlike in southern Spain, Diego experienced a moderate Spanish accent. Diego and his two younger brothers,
      Mitch and Henry, are captured below.
